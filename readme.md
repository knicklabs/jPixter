*jPixter*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
jPixter is a jQuery plugin that transforms an unordered list with nested divs for 
captions into a slideshow. It includes autoscrolling, pause/resume control, and 
next and previous navigation. The markup is simple and easy to style with a number
of customization options out of the box.

*Instructions*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Better instructions coming soon. But here's enough to get you started.

You can instantiate the plugin using .jPixter({}). Options include:
- speed (float: duration of transition in milliseconds)
- interval (float: duration of stay on each slide)
- caption (boolean: turn captions on/off)
- captionOpacity (float)
- captionPositionY (string: 'top or bottom' puts caption at top and controls at bottom)
- captionPositionX (string: 'left or right' puts caption to left or right)
- captionFullWidth (boolean: stretch caption to left and right edges)
- deck (string: the name of the parent element)
- photoDeck (string: the name of the unordered list containing the photos/captions)
- controls (string: the name of the div containing the controls)
